# Inclusive style guides

There are many great examples out there of community Codes of Conduct that emphasize inclusive spaces (see, for instance, the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)).  But there's fewer examples of style guides which give examples of non-inclusive language while concretely suggesting alternative terms.

This repo aims to be a living directory of such style guides.  Pull requests are accepted and encouraged!
